        Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created
        by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song
        of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the
        first of which is A Game of Thrones.The show was shot in the United
        Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It
        premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded
        on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.Set on
        the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a
        large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course
        of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven
        Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the
        noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for
        independence from whoever sits on it. The second focuses on the last
        descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to
        Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third
        follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against
        threats from beyond Westeros' northern border.

        Set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of
        Essos. The series follows several simultaneous plot lines. The first
        story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for
        control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble
        families fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns
        the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles
        the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures
        and fierce peoples of the North.
