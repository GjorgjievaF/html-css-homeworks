    <h3><i>Formula od natural flavorings</i></h3>

    <h4>
      A typical can of Coca-Cola (12 fl ounces/355 ml) contains 39 grams of
      sugar,[63] 50 mg of sodium, 0 grams fat, 0 grams potassium, and 140
      calories.[64] On May 5, 2014, Coca-Cola said it was working to remove a
      controversial ingredient, brominated vegetable oil, from its drinks.
    </h4>

    <p>
      The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other
      ingredients, which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a trade
      secret. The original copy of the formula was held in Truist Financial's
      main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company,
      was the underwriter for the Coca-Cola Company's initial public offering in
      1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the
      vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which will
      be on display for visitors to its World of Coca-Cola museum in downtown
      Atlanta.

      According to Snopes, a popular myth states that only two executives have
      access to the formula, with each executive having only half the formula.
      However, several sources state that while Coca-Cola does have a rule
      restricting access to only two executives, each knows the entire formula
      and others, in addition to the prescribed duo, have known the formulation
      process.
