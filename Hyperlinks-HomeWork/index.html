      the world's sixth most valuable brand.The name refers to two of its
      original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).
      The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a
      variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been
      published. The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in
      its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.
      The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of
      soft drink: colas.

      The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed
      Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive
      territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans
      and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and
      sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams
      (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup in
      North America). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise
      Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout
      the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains
      of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.

      Sugar, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with
      lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from July
      1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from "New Coke".
