      Confederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and
      addicted to morphine, also had a medical degree and began a quest to find
      a substitute for the problematic drug.In 1885 at Pemberton's Eagle Drug
      and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered
      Pemberton's French Wine Coca nerve tonic. Pemberton's tonic may have been
      inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a French-Corsican coca
      wine,but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the
      beverage's source of caffeine. A Spanish drink called "Kola Coca" was
      presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official
      birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by
      Coca-Cola in 1953.

      He first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the Coca-Cola drink was
      painted in 1894 in Cartersville, Georgia. Cola syrup was sold as an
      over-the-counter dietary supplement for upset stomach.By the time of its
      50th anniversary, the soft drink had reached the status of a national icon
      in the US. In 1935, it was certified kosher by Atlanta rabbi Tobias
      Geffen. With the help of Harold Hirsch, Geffen was the first person
      outside the company to see the top-secret ingredients list after Coke
      faced scrutiny from the American Jewish population regarding the drink's
      kosher status.Consequently, the company made minor changes in the sourcing
      of some ingredients so it could continue to be consumed by America's
      Jewish population, including during Passover. A yellow cap on a Coca-Cola
      drink indicates that it is kosher.

      On July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in
      Iraq for the first time since the Arab League boycotted the company in
      1968. In April 2007, in Canada, the name "Coca-Cola Classic" was changed
      back to "Coca-Cola". The word "Classic" was removed because "New Coke" was
      no longer in production, eliminating the need to differentiate between the
      two.The formula remained unchanged. In January 2009, Coca-Cola stopped
      printing the word "Classic" on the labels of 16-US-fluid-ounce (470 ml)
      bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States. The change was
      part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image. The word
      "Classic" was removed from all Coca-Cola products by 2011. In November
      2009, due to a dispute over wholesale prices of Coca-Cola products, Costco
      stopped restocking its shelves with Coke and Diet Coke for two months; a
      separate pouring rights deal in 2013 saw Coke products removed from Costco
      food courts in favor of Pepsi. Some Costco locations (such as the ones in
      Tucson, Arizona) additionally sell imported Coca-Cola from Mexico with
      cane sugar instead of corn syrup from separate distributors. Coca-Cola
      introduced the 7.5-ounce mini-can in 2009 That same day, Coca-Cola
