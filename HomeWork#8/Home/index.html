          Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created
          by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A
          Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R.
          Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show premiered on
          HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19,
          2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

        <p>
          Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones
          has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout
          the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne
          of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts
          among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting
          for independence from whoever sits on it. The second focuses on the
          last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been
          exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The
          third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm
          against threats from beyond Westeros' northern border.
