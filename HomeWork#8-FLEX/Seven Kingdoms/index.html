          Over time, seven relatively stable feudal kingdoms were forged across
          Westeros, although their territories fluctuated over the next few
          thousand years through constant warfare, and no kingdom remained
          dominant for long:

        <h4>History</h4>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Prior to Aegon's Conquest, seven large sovereign kingdoms existed on
          the continent; the Kingdom of the North, the Kingdom of the Mountain
          and Vale, the Kingdom of the Isles and Rivers, the Kingdom of the
          Rock, the Kingdom of the Reach, the Kingdom of the Stormlands, and the
          Principality of Dorne. To the north of the Seven Kingdoms laid the
          Wall, manned by the Night's Watch, and beyond the Wall; the lawless
          lands inhabited by the wildlings. Dragonstone and it's surrounding
          islands remained independent, ruled by House Targaryen, the last of
          the dragonlords following the Doom of Valyria.
        </p>

        <h4>Aegon's Conquest</h4>
        <p>
          After being spurned by King Argilac Durrandon of the Stormlands, Lord
          Aegon Targaryen and his sister-wives launched a campaign to conquer
          the continent. Utilising the overwhelming firepower of their three
          dragons, the Targaryens soon conquered six of the Seven Kingdoms,
          although Dorne under House Martell refused to surrender and managed to
          avoid formal conquest. Despite House Targaryen claiming rule over the
          entire continent south of the Wall, Dorne remained de-facto
          independent for nearly two centuries after the Conquest. Only during
          the rule of King Daeron II Targaryen, was Dorne brought peacefully
          into the realm through a series of negotiations and marriage pacts.
        </p>

        <h4>Targaryen era</h4>
        <p>
          Out of the swords of his fallen enemies, Aegon Targaryen constructed
          the Iron Throne. He also built a new castle, the Red Keep, at the
          mouth of the Blackwater Rush, where his forces had initially landed
          during the Conquest. A city grew around the castle, aptly named King's
          Landing. Around a century and three decades after the Conquest, the
          Seven Kingdoms were devastated by a catastrophic war of succession
          between King Aegon II Targaryen and his supporters, and Queen Rhaenyra
          Targaryen and her supporters. The war proved indecisive, and resulted
          in the last of House Targaryen's dragons dying off within a
          generation, significantly weakening House Targaryen. House Targaryen
          entered further decline with the beginning of the Blackfyre
          Rebellions, after King Aegon IV Targaryen legitimised Daemon Waters on
          his deathbed. Furthermore, the Targaryen practice of incestuous
          marriages resulted in many children of such unions succumbing to
          madness later in life.
        </p>

        <h4>Robert's Rebellion</h4>
        <p>
          After nearly three centuries on the Iron Throne, House Targaryen was
          deposed and supplanted by House Baratheon during Robert's Rebellion,
          with it's last remnants going into exile in the Free Cities of Essos.
        </p>

        <h4>War of the Five Kings</h4>
        <p>
          Following the death of King Robert Baratheon, the realm fractured once
          again in a war of succession. During the conflict, the North and the
          Iron Islands attempted to break away as independent states, but as the
          Great War loomed, both abandoned their pursuits of independence and
          aligned behind Queen Daenerys Targaryen, who had since returned from
          exile in Essos.
        </p>

        <h4>Great War</h4>
        <p>
          The White Walkers, having previously been defeated thousands of years
          prior and relegated to myth and legend, broke through the Wall and
          invaded the Seven Kingdoms. They were eventually defeated for good
          during the Battle of King's Landing by a coalition of the living, lead
          by Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow.
        </p>

        <h4>Baratheon era</h4>
        <p>
          Both Daenerys and Jon perished during the Great War, leaving the son
          of Robert Baratheon and Daenerys's designated heir, Gendry Baratheon,
          to inherit the rule of the Seven Kingdoms in their absence. With the
          White Walkers defeated, the Wall was abandoned and the Free Folk under
          Tormund Giantsbane accepted the suzerainty of House Stark of the
          North, thus in effect extending the Seven Kingdoms to encompass the
          entire continent. Ten years later, the conclusion of the War of the
          Narrow Sea led to the Stepstones being annexed into the Seven
          Kingdoms, although they are not formally a part of any kingdom,
          instead being ruled by the quasi-military force, the Stepstones Guard.
