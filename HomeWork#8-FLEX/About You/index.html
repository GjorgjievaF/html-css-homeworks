            Jon Snow is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire
            series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and
            its HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones, in which he is
            portrayed by Kit Harington. In the novels, he is a prominent point
            of view character. He is one of the most popular characters in the
            series, and The New York Times cites him as one of the author's
            finest creations. Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his
            storyline in the season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among
            viewers. Speculation about the character's parentage has also been a
            popular topic of discussion among fans of both the books and the TV
            series. Jon is introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones as the
            illegitimate son of Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell in the North of
            Westeros. Knowing his prospects are limited by his status as a
            bastard, Jon joins the Night's Watch, who guard the far northern
            borders from the wildlings living beyond The Wall. In A Clash of
            Kings (1998), Jon joins a scouting party investigating the growing
            threat from the otherworldly "Others" beyond the Wall, and
            infiltrates the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade
            Westeros in A Storm of Swords (2000), and falls in love with the
            wildling woman Ygritte. Jon betrays the wildlings and Ygritte,
            returns to defend the Night's Watch against the wildlings' invasion,
            and is elected Lord Commander of the Watch. He appears briefly in A
            Feast for Crows (2005) and returns as a prominent character in A
            Dance with Dragons (2011), in which he works to negotiate an
            alliance between the Night's Watch and the wildlings against the
            Others; his policies are met with hostility by some among the Watch,
            and he is left for dead in a mutiny at the novel's end following a
            desired attempt to break his vows to fight House Bolton. In the Game
            of Thrones television series, Jon's storyline follows the
            character's plot arc from the novel series, though seasons 6-8
            continue on from the events of Martin's latest published
            installment, detailing Jon's resurrection, and revealing him to have
            been born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen,
            firstborn son of the Mad King, and Lyanna Stark, therefore
            possessing a stronger claim to the Iron Throne than Daenerys
            Targaryen whose birthright is now contested. For the role, Harington
            was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television
            Series Drama in 2019, two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting
            Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series
            in 2016 and 2019, and two Critics' Choice Television Awards.

            In A Game of Thrones (1996), Daenerys is sold by her brother Viserys
            and Illyrio Mopatis into a marriage with Khal Drogo, a Dothraki
            warlord, for an army for Viserys. Daenerys befriends Jorah Mormont,
            an exiled Westerosi knight. At her wedding, she is given three
            petrified dragon eggs by Illyrio Mopatis. Although Daenerys is
            initially terrified of Drogo, their marriage grows into a happy
            union. She comes to love him and takes to Dothraki customs, finding
            strength for the first time, and she stands up to Viserys's attempts
            to bully her into coercing Drogo. When Viserys threatens her, Drogo
            kills him by pouring molten gold over his head. With Viserys dead,
            Daenerys sees herself as the heir to the Targaryen dynasty and
            responsible for reclaiming the throne for her family. Later, Drogo
            is wounded in a fight, and the cut festers. With Drogo ill, his
            warriors mutiny and abandon him. In desperation, Daenerys recruits
            an enslaved Lhazareen priestess, Mirri Maz Duur, to save Drogo with
            blood magic. Despite being saved by Daenerys from being raped by the
            tribe's warriors, however, the priestess betrays her and the magic
            ritual results in Daenerys's unborn child being stillborn and leaves
            Drogo in a catatonic state. Because Drogo will never recover,
            Daenerys smothers him with a pillow. She burns the priestess in
            Drogo's funeral pyre and climbs into the flames with her three
            dragon eggs. When the pyre dies out the following morning, Daenerys
            emerges from the ashes alive and unburned with three hatched
            dragons.

            Sansa Stark is the second child and the elder of the two daughters
            born to Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Stark, the ruling liege
            of the North. She was born and raised in Winterfell with an older
            brother Robb, a younger sister Arya, two younger brothers Bran and
            Rickon, as well as an older bastard half-brother Jon Snow. Through
            her mother, Sansa is also first cousin to Robert Arryn, the lord
            paramount of The Vale; and the niece of Edmure Tully, the lord
            paramount of the Riverlands. She was once betrothed to Crown Prince
            Joffrey Baratheon, and is still legally married (though never
            consummated) to Tyrion Lannister by the end of A Dance with Dragons.
            Raised as a noblewoman, Sansa embodies the traditional femininity
            stereotype expected by the Westerosi society, and is widely praised
            as a courteous and lovable young maiden. Sansa has been described as
            tall, slim, womanly and classically beautiful, destined to be a lady
            or a queen. Inheriting from her mother, Sansa has the Tully features
            of blue eyes, high cheekbones and thick auburn hair, but later has
            her hair dyed dark brown while hiding in the Vale under the guise of
            "Alayne Stone", the alleged bastard daughter of Petyr Baelish.
            Sansa's interests are music, poetry and singing, and she excels in
            embroidery works. She fantasizes of becoming like the damsels of
            romantic tales who will find a prince, knight, or gentleman to fall
            in love with. She once owned a direwolf cub named Lady, which was
            killed in place of her sister Arya's direwolf Nymeria, after the
            latter fled after attacking and wounding Crown Prince Joffrey. Sansa
            is 11 years old at the beginning of A Game of Thrones and nearly 14
            at the end of A Feast for Crows. The most naive of the Stark
            children at the start of the series, Sansa chooses the treacherous
            Queen Cersei over her father and finds herself abused by her then
            fiancé Joffrey, and used as a pawn in the machinations of House
            Lannister. However, as the story progresses, she matures and becomes
            more of a strategic player of the political game.

            Tyrion is intelligent, witty, well-read, and shares his father's
            skill for business and political maneuvering.[11] Grossman described
            the character as "a bitter, cynical, high-born dwarf", calling him
            "Martin's Falstaff". David Orr of The New York Times called Tyrion
            "a cynic, a drinker, an outcast and conspicuously the novels' most
            intelligent presence". As an outcast, he displays sympathy for other
            outcasts and the otherwise mistreated; the TV series version of the
            character commiserates with the illegitimate son of Ned Stark by
            saying, "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.Still, he is
            usually seen for his deformities and vices, rather than his virtues
            and good deeds.Tom Shippey of the Wall Street Journal wrote that
            other characters underestimate Tyrion: "His dwarf-status acts as a
            kind of protection, because—though he is probably the most
            intelligent character in the whole cast list—no one takes him
            seriously. Acknowledging that Tyrion's wit, humor and cunning are
            his survival mechanism, actor Dinklage told The New York Times that
            "He knows he has no skills with the sword and this is a world that
            is really deeply violent. Military rules. He would not be able to
            survive in that world, given his own strength. So he beats people to
            the punchline—he's entertaining.

            Arya was born in 289 AC ("After (Aegon's) Conquest") as the third
            child and youngest daughter of Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn Stark of
            Winterfell, the ruling liege of the North, and is nine years old at
            the beginning of the book series and 11 in season 1 of the show. She
            has five siblings: an older brother Robb, an older sister Sansa, two
            younger brothers Bran and Rickon, and an older illegitimate
            half-brother, Jon Snow. Through her mother, she is also first cousin
            to Robert Arryn, the lord paramount of The Vale; and the niece of
            Edmure Tully, the lord paramount of the Riverlands. Arya is
            left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping. In contrast to
            her older sister Sansa, who is more praised for favoring activities
            traditionally befitting a noblewoman, Arya shows no interest in the
            ladylike dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in outdoor
            activities and exploring, and is an excellent horserider. She is
            described as "wolf-blooded", blunt, impulsive and "always difficult
            to tame" by her mother Catelyn, proven to be a constant source of
            headache for her household tutor Septa Mordane, and given the
            nickname "Arya Underfoot" by the guards of Winterfell. Socially an
            outcast, she is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon
            Snow, who encourages her and gives her a smallsword as a parting
            gift.The sword, which Arya names "Needle" after her dreaded
            embroidery lessons, is well suited to her slender build and favoring
            the Braavosi "Water Dance" (fencing) style of swordplay which
            emphasizes speed and agility with quick thrusting attacks.
            Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and
            cunning and also becomes increasingly ruthless. Arya is the only one
            out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark features of lean
            athletic physique, brown hair, grey eyes and long face (for which
            she was teased as "Horseface" by Sansa's companions), and is said to
            resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks and temperament.[3] At
            the start of the series, she is prepubescent and generally regarded
            as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but there
            are multiple instances in the books comparing her (favorably) to the
            famously beautiful Lyanna, and frequently catching the eyes of men
            (to the point of harassment) when her body starts to develop later
            in the series. She is also a powerful skinchanger, developing purely
            on her own instinct the ability to telepathically control her
            direwolf Nymeria when sleeping (even from a different continent), as
            well as a psychic bond with a street tomcat in Braavos.
